Your final project will be a comprehensive Student Database Management System that includes:

- **Student Record Management**: Add, view, modify, and delete student information
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load data using file I/O operations
- **Search Functionality**: Find students by name, ID, or grade
- **Sorting Capabilities**: Organize student records by various criteria
- **User Interface**: Menu-driven system for easy interaction

## 📖 Recommended Resources

### Essential Reading
- **"The C Programming Language"** by Kernighan & Ritchie (K&R)
- **"Modern C for Absolute Beginners"** by Slobodan Dmitrović

### Development Tools
- **Compiler**: GCC (recommended)
- **Editor**: VS Code, Code::Blocks, or any text editor
- **Debugger**: GDB for troubleshooting

## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Practice Daily**: Consistency is key - spend at least 1-2 hours each day
2. **Type Code Yourself**: Don't copy-paste; typing helps muscle memory
3. **Experiment**: Try variations of each exercise to deepen understanding
4. **Debug Actively**: Learn to read error messages and use debugging tools
5. **Take Notes**: Document key concepts and gotchas for future reference
